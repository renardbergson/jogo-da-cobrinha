to work with canvas, first we get it into a variable and then we get it's context, using the 
canvasVariable.getContext('renderstyle') method


ctx.fillStyle (this property sets the style for drawing an object)
ctx.fillRect  (this function applies the previous style, it receives: x position, y position, width, height)


in this case, the setTimeout() function is what's going to countinuously update the screen, based
on the speedGame variable. We can use the console.log to see how it works


setting the tileSize based on canvas.width divided per the tileCount variable give us freedom to 
update better the tileSize in the future, if we want


for now, we wanna get the 200 value for X and Y angles, because the screen game has 400x400 so, 
200 for both is the middle of the screen
