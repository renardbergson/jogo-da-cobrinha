To work with canvas, first we get it into a variable and then we get it's context, using the 
canvasVariable.getContext('renderStyle') method


ctx.fillStyle (this property sets the style for drawing an object)
ctx.fillRect  (this function applies the previous style, it receives: x position, y position, width, 
height)


In this game, the setTimeout() function is what's going to countinuously update the screen, based
on the speedGame variable. We can use the console.log to see how it works


Setting the tileSize based on canvas.width divided per the tileCount variable give us freedom to 
update better the tileSize in the future, if we want


For now, we wanna get the 200 value for the snake initial position, for the X and Y angles, because the screen 
game has 400x400 so, 200 for both is the middle of the screen


The appendChild() method adds an element into another one


The onresize() method let us do something when the screen size changes, we can also use "window.screen.width/height" 
to do something like that


The Math.random() method returns random numbers between 0 and 1, so we used it into parseInt method to convert those 
numbers to integer values, at the end, we multiplied those numbers by the number of tiles


The push() method adds an element into an array


The shift() method removes the furtherst item from an array. In our case, we wanted that, if the array had more itens 
than our tailLenght variable, the furtherst item was removed, because the last part added is always the nearest to the 
snake head


In the draw snake function, multiplying the head, body or apple position by the number of tiles gives us the right number 
of possibilities for X and Y angles


Having the screen update function avoids that the snake path remains on the screen 


** The sessionStorage() method let us store a key and value in the browser but only while the user not closes the tab, that's
very useful to do lots of interesting things. In our case, we used that method after que first game over message, to know if 
the user already had opened the application and, not show the initial instructions anymore **


The location.reload() method reloads the current document
